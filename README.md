# TensorFlow.js

My first TensorFlow.js project.
This library allows you to harness huge power of neural nets models that are already build using TensorFlow or Keras, making your JS application look almost like magic. You are also able to create models from scratch with new JavaScript API and train them using clientâ€™s GPU processing power.
